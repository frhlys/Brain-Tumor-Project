# Brain-Tumor-Project
Hi coders, this mini project focuses on segmenting brain tumors using four different MRI modalities using MATLAB.

Key Features:

1.Utilizes T1, T1CE, T2, and FLAIR MRI images

2.Designed segmentation algorithm for training data (15 samples)

3.Applies the trained approach to generate segmentation masks for test data

4.Saves output segmentations in batch for evaluation
